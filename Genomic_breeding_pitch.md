# Genomic Animal Breeding part 2 -- Current Challenges in Animal Genomics

Three broad sections covering "modern" genomic analysis
 - Genomic sequencing
 - Applying genomic data
 - Transition to pangenomics

followed by some other topics rapidly gaining attraction like CRISPR.

Intended as an introduction to techniques currently employed in many fields of agricultural research.

Would cover 11 lectures and 2 practical sessions (~2 credit points).
PhD students can participate as teaching assistants during the practicals.

## Developed competencies

 - **Describe** recent advances in genomic sequencing and **interpret** their impact on the type and scale of genomic studies now possible.
 - **Integrate** different sources of genomic sequencing to **produce** variant sets or genome assemblies.
 -**Judge** which sequencing technologies would be useful for answering questions.
 - Assess pangenome graphs and **estimate** possible associations between variation and phenotypes. 

## Examination

Integrated performance assessment

> Given a pangenome, produce

 - whole-graph visualisation
 - identify a region of interest (complex variation, gene-SV, etc)
 - examine the region of interest in detail
   - visualise the subgraph
   - identify which alleles correspond to which samples
   - support the hypothesis using an independent methodology or source of data 

Option for assessed student presentations

Written examination covering

 - sequencing project design?
 - approaches for determining whole-genome variation within a population
 - advantages of pangenomes over linear reference genomes
 - potential applications and challenges of gene editing within agricultural uses
